A presentation showcasing Marp's custom theming capabilities

<!-- Welcome to this custom theme demonstration. This presentation showcases how custom CSS themes can completely transform the look and feel of your Marp slides. -->

## Why Custom Themes?

- **Brand Consistency**: Match your company or personal brand
- **Visual Impact**: Stand out from default templates
- **Flexibility**: Complete control over styling
- **Reusability**: Use the same theme across presentations

<!-- Custom themes allow you to create a consistent visual identity across all your presentations. You can define colors, fonts, layouts, and even animations that align with your brand guidelines. -->

## Theme Features

### Colors & Typography

## Code Example

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
